# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

## Overview
The **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction** project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and forecasting their potential future value to a business. This analysis is critical for businesses aiming to improve customer retention, optimize marketing efforts, and maximize profits.

This project employs machine learning models and data analysis techniques to predict the CLV of customers based on historical data. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation steps.

## Features
1. **Data Analysis & Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data entries.
   - Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing customer behaviors and trends.
   - Identifying correlations between variables.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Generating meaningful features that improve model performance.
   - Transforming raw data into actionable insights.

4. **Modeling & Prediction:**
   - Training machine learning models to predict CLV.
   - Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.

5. **Result Visualization:**
   - Graphical representation of predictions and their accuracy.
   - Insights into which factors contribute most to CLV.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries:
- Python (3.x)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. **Prepare the Dataset:**
   - Ensure the dataset is in the correct format (e.g., CSV) and contains relevant fields such as customer ID, purchase history, demographics, etc.

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Customer_Lifetime_Value_Prediction.ipynb`) and execute each cell sequentially.
   - Follow the inline documentation for detailed guidance.

3. **Interpret the Results:**
   - Use the final model predictions to identify high-value customers.
   - Leverage insights to tailor business strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes:
- Customer demographics (age, gender, location, etc.).
- Transaction history (purchase frequency, monetary value, etc.).
- Behavioral data (website visits, product views, etc.).

Ensure your dataset aligns with these features for optimal model performance.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning and organizing data for analysis.
   - Preparing training and testing datasets.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Visualizing and summarizing key data points.

3. **Model Selection & Training:**
   - Testing various machine learning models.
   - Optimizing hyperparameters for improved accuracy.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Exporting the trained model for integration into business systems.
